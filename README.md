# Action Platformer

*Action Platformer* is a hybrid 2.5D combat game developed using **Unreal Engine**, created as part of [*The Ultimate Unreal Engine 2D Game Development Course*](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-2d-course/) on **Udemy**, taught by **Cobra Code**.

## About the Game
In *Action Platformer*, players take control of a 2D pirate character navigating through a 3D environment. The game combines traditional platforming with enhanced **combat mechanics** and **unlockable abilities**, offering more depth and complexity than previous projects in the series.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- 2D characters in a 3D world (2.5D perspective).
- Enhanced melee combat system.
- Ability unlocking (e.g. sword throwing)
- Enemies with more complex AI

This project showcases a more advanced use of Unreal Engine's tools, blending 2D and 3D assets, managing combat states, and implementing character progression systems. Features such as animation overrides are used for easier and better animations.

## Purpose

This is the **fourth project** in a series of small games built as hands-on practice for learning 2D game development in Unreal Engine through the Udemy course by Cobra Code.
